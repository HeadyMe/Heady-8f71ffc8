Pre-Migration Preparation:
-------------------------
□ Backup important emails from ProtonMail
□ Export contacts from ProtonMail
□ Note any auto-filters or rules in ProtonMail
□ Inform contacts of potential email disruption
□ Choose migration window (low-traffic period)

Day 1: Nameserver Change
------------------------
□ Login to domain registrar
□ Update nameservers to Cloudflare
□ Save confirmation of changes
□ Start 24-48 hour propagation timer

Day 1-2: Propagation Period
---------------------------
□ Monitor nameserver propagation: dig NS headyconnection.org
□ Check email continuity (may be interrupted)
□ Prepare for temporary email disruption
□ Keep ProtonMail accessible during transition

Day 2-3: Cloudflare Setup
-------------------------
□ Verify domain active in Cloudflare Dashboard
□ Enable Email Routing in Cloudflare
□ Create forwarding rule: e@headyconnection.com → eric@headyconnection.org
□ Test email forwarding
□ Verify MX records are correct

Day 3: Verification
------------------
□ Send test emails to e@headyconnection.com
□ Check delivery to eric@headyconnection.org
□ Verify email headers show forwarding
□ Check spam folder
□ Test from multiple senders

Day 3-7: Monitoring
------------------
□ Monitor email delivery for 3-5 days
□ Check for any missed emails
□ Update any services using old email
□ Inform contacts migration complete

Post-Migration:
--------------

□ Important clients/partners
□ Service providers (billing, etc.)
□ Website contact forms

- Nameserver change: 15 minutes
- DNS propagation: 24-48 hours

- Testing period: 3-5 days
- Total migration: 3-7 days

Risk Assessment:
