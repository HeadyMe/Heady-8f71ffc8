# The Heady Project: Daily Manifest

**Purpose**: To force a split-second decision on every input and track the "Resolution" of your active projects.

## DAILY COMMAND LOG

**Date**: ____________

**CURRENT ENERGY STATE**:
  [ ] Low (Scatter)   [ ] Medium (Stable)   [ ] High (Directed)

### PART A: THE FILTER (The 99%)

*List 3 things currently entering your awareness that you will NOT interact with today.*
*(Command: "Status Quo Maintained. Zero Joules Allocated.")*

1. ___________________________________________________________
2. ___________________________________________________________
3. ___________________________________________________________

### PART B: THE ACTIVE PROJECTS (The 1%)

*List the things you intend to change "for real."*
---

**PROJECT 1**: _________________________________________________

- **Current Snapshot Resolution**: [ ] Low (Blurry)  [ ] High (Clear)
- **Energy Signature**: [ ] Anxiety/Rush  [ ] Clarity/Calm
- **ACTION**: [ ] Wait/Render (Go to Sandbox)   [ ] Execute (Pulse)

**PROJECT 2**: _________________________________________________

- **Current Snapshot Resolution**: [ ] Low (Blurry)  [ ] High (Clear)
- **Energy Signature**: [ ] Anxiety/Rush  [ ] Clarity/Calm
- **ACTION**: [ ] Wait/Render (Go to Sandbox)   [ ] Execute (Pulse)

### PART C: SYSTEM ALERTS (Anxiety/Friction Check)

*Did I feel a "Collision Error" (Unexpected Change) today?*
[ ] No
[ ] Yes -> Description: ______________________________________
        -> Adjustment: [ ] Update Snapshot   [ ] Abandon Project

## THE SIMULATION SANDBOX (Renderer)

**Purpose**: Systematically increase the resolution of a Snapshot before acting.
*When to use*: When you checked "Wait/Render" in the Daily Log.

1. **Enter Neutrality**: Sit quiet.
2. **Load the Object**: Bring project/conversation into mind.
3. **Run Simulation**:
   - "If I take Action X, what is the immediate physical change?"
   - "What is the likely reaction of the environment?"
   - "Does this outcome match my intent?"
4. **Check the Vibe**: Does it feel frictionless?
   - **Yes**: High-Res. Clear to launch.
   - **No**: Identify friction point. Change variable. Re-run.
5. **Exit**: Secure the Golden Path before leaving the Sandbox.

## VAMPIRE AUDIT (Leak Detector)

*Review weekly (e.g., Sunday Night).*
Where did Directed Energy leak?

1. **Open Loops**: Unfinished tasks. → *Delete or Schedule.*
2. **Zombie Relationships**: Yield no change but drain energy. → *Distance/Conclude.*
3. **Phantom Processes**: Worrying about "Do Not Touch" items. → *Re-assert No Interaction.*
