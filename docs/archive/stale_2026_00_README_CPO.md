## Relationship to Other Docs

- **`docs/market-intel/`** — positioning, battlecards, GTM experiments, pricing tiers. This CPO suite *layers above* market-intel; it does not duplicate it.
- **`heady-registry.json`** — canonical service catalog, AI nodes, SLOs, pricing. Architecture docs reference and cite it.
- **`STANDING_DIRECTIVE.md`** — infrastructure reality, subscriptions, routing tiers. Operating model docs reference it.

## Update Cadence

- **Weekly:** Scorecard refresh, roadmap status
- **Monthly:** Portfolio + architecture review
- **Quarterly:** Vertical prioritization + packaging review
