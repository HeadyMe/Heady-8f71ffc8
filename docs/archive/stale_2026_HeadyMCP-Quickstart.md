# HeadyMCP — Quickstart Guide

> **Notice:** As of the February 2026 Heady Systems Production Go-Live, the HeadyMCP configuration has been consolidated into the core platform documentation.

Heady provides a unified, local MCP server (`heady-local`) exposing 40+ specialized tools for seamless IDE integration.

## Canonical Documentation

Please refer to the following updated resources:

1. **[Integrations Guide](./INTEGRATIONS.md#mcp-server-integration)** — For HeadyMCP capabilities, available tools, and IDE configuration paths.
2. **[Quick Start Guide](./QUICKSTART.md)** — For initial Heady platform setup and architecture overview.
3. **[API Reference](./API.md)** — For programmatic interaction with HeadyBrain if bypassing the MCP layer.

*Historical MCP configurations targeting `heady.io` have been deprecated in favor of the unified `headyio.com` / `headymcp.com` infrastructure.*
