# Heady AI Platform — Executive Brief

> Last updated: February 24, 2026 — Production Go-Live  
> Owner: HeadyMe (<e@headyconnection.org>)

## What Is Heady?

Heady is an autonomous multi-agent AI operating system. It federates 20 intelligence nodes through a liquid routing conductor, secured by post-quantum cryptography. Everything runs on bare metal with Cloudflare edge acceleration.

## Core Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Edge | Cloudflare Workers AI + Vectorize + KV + Tunnels |
| Router | HeadyConductor (federated liquid routing) |
| Intelligence | 20 AI Nodes (HeadyBrain, HeadyBattle, HeadyCoder, etc.) |
| Swarm | HeadySwarm + HeadyBees (headless browser fleet) |
| Memory | DuckDB V2 (HNSW vector index) |
| Security | PQC (ML-KEM + ML-DSA) + mTLS + Rate Limiting |

## 20 AI Nodes

HeadyBrain, HeadyBattle, HeadyCoder, HeadyCopilot, HeadyCodex, HeadyVinci, HeadySoul, HeadyLens, HeadyJules, HeadyPythia, HeadyGroq, HeadyGemini, HeadyClaude, HeadyOpenAI, HeadyEdge, HeadyPerplexity, HeadyHuggingFace, HeadyOrchestrator, HeadySwarm, HeadyBees.

Billing powered by Stripe with Firebase authentication.

## Competitive Position

Heady is the only platform that combines:

- 20 specialized AI nodes (not a single-model wrapper)
- Post-quantum cryptography (ML-KEM + ML-DSA)
- Headless browser swarm (HeadyBees) for autonomous task completion
- Federated liquid routing with 3D vector zone placement
- Arena mode (HeadyBattle) for continuous validation

## Current Status: PRODUCTION LIVE

As of February 24, 2026, the Heady AI Platform is in **PRODUCTION-LIVE** state. The Full-Throttle Auto-Flow Success Pipeline runs continuously, processing optimizations and fidelity improvements.

All 19 branded sites are deployed and serving via Cloudflare tunnel. All configs, docs, and code are free of stale data.
