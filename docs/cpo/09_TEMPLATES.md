## 1. PRD Template

```markdown
# PRD: [Feature Name]

## Summary
One paragraph: what, for whom, why now.

## Problem
What pain does this solve? Evidence (user feedback, metrics, competitor gap).

## Proposed Solution
- **Surface(s):** [Buddy / IDE / Admin / MCP / API]
- **AI Nodes:** [Which of the 7 nodes are needed]
- **MCP Connectors:** [Which tool integrations]
- **Policy Level:** [L0 / L1 / L2 / L3]

## Success Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| [KPI 1] | — | — | [How measured] |
| [KPI 2] | — | — | [How measured] |

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| [Risk 1] | [H/M/L] | [Strategy] |

## Dependencies
- **Requires:** [What must exist first]
- **Blocks:** [What this unlocks]

## HeadyBattle Questions
- What is the primary purpose?
- What could go wrong?
- Is this the most elegant solution?

## Timeline
Phase / relative sequencing (not dates).

## Approval

## 2. RFC Template

```markdown
# RFC: [Technical Proposal Title]

## Status
[DRAFT | REVIEW | APPROVED | IMPLEMENTED | REJECTED]

## Context
What problem or opportunity triggers this RFC?

## Decision
What is the proposed technical decision?

## Alternatives Considered
| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Why Not |
|-------------|------|------|---------|
| [Alt 1] | | | |
| [Alt 2] | | | |

## Architecture Impact
- **Components affected:** [Registry components]
- **Services affected:** [Which of 19 services]
- **API changes:** [New / modified endpoints]
- **Config changes:** [Which YAML files]

## Arena Mode Strategy

## Migration Plan
Step-by-step for existing systems.

## Rollback Plan
How to revert if things go wrong.

## HeadyBattle Interrogation
- Purpose alignment?
- Unintended consequences?
- Simplification opportunities?

## Approvers
