# Competitive Landscape: Categories, Competitors, and Heady's Wedge

## 5 Market Lanes

1. AI coding assistants & AI-native IDEs
2. Agentic workflow platforms + integrations
3. Observability / AIOps / incident response
4. Internal developer platforms / control planes
5. Cloud deployment & orchestration

Heady touches all five — powerful but requires disciplined positioning.

## Heady's Right to Win: The Trust Wedge

**Competitors optimize for generation volume. Heady optimizes for verifiable outcomes.**

## Competitor Sets

### HeadyAI-IDE Competitors

GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codeium, Replit, JetBrains AI, Sourcegraph Cody  
**Angle:** "Arena + Consensus for trustworthy shipping"

### HeadyMCP Competitors

MCP ecosystem implementations, agent frameworks, vendor plugin marketplaces  
**Angle:** "Governed marketplace with safe execution + audit"

### HeadyCheck Competitors

Datadog, Splunk, New Relic, Grafana, Elastic, Sentry, Honeycomb  
**Angle:** "Ecosystem-native observability that reduces tool overload"

### HeadyCloud Competitors

Render, Vercel, Netlify, Fly.io, Kubernetes platforms  
**Angle:** "Deployment as governed extension of intelligence stack"

## Battlecards (Starter)

### vs Copilot-first

- **They say:** "Fastest path to more code output"
- **We say:** "Fastest path to *trusted* output"
- **Must prove:** fix-loop reduction, consensus confidence, audit trails

### vs Observability Vendors

- **They say:** "Unified full-stack observability"
- **We say:** "Unified observability with intelligence-driven remediation"
- **Must prove:** faster MTTR, fewer tools required

### vs MCP Ecosystem

- **They say:** "Connect everything quickly"
- **We say:** "Connect everything safely"
- **Must prove:** approvals, allowlists, signed tool calls

## We Win When

- Buyer worries about correctness/security/auditability
- Tool sprawl is painful
- Scaling agentic workflows

## We Lose When

- They only want autocomplete
- They refuse governance overhead
- No security owner exists
