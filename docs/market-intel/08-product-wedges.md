# Product Wedges & Differentiators (Unified Story)

## Master Thesis

Heady is not "more generation." Heady is **verification + governance + routing + observability** across the full stack.

## Differentiator Map

### 1) Arena + Consensus (Trust Plane)

**Promise:** Compare strategies, converge on safer output, reduce fix loops.  

- Arena Mode: fast vs balanced vs thorough strategy competition
- Consensus Engine: multi-model agreement with confidence scoring
- **Proof target:** measurable drop in rollback rate + fix-loop time

### 2) Conductor + Registry (Capability Plane)

**Promise:** A single plane that knows nodes, workflows, services, tools, and health — routes intelligently.  

- Registry-driven service catalog with health scans + SLO targets
- HeadyConductor: federated liquid routing with layer weights
- **Why it matters:** reduces complexity, enables enterprise governance, creates pricing leverage

### 3) Validator-before-Dispatch (Policy Plane)

**Promise:** No unsafe action executes without policy checks.  

- Pre-action protocol: registry check, memory scan, pattern check, audit trail
- Identity + auth + allowlist + sanitization + approval gates
- **Why it matters:** converts architecture into product guarantee

### 4) Liquid Routing + Supervisors (Performance Plane)

**Promise:** High concurrency, adaptive routing, self-optimizing flows.  

- MIN_CONCURRENT=150 supervisors always active
- Adaptive routing with backpressure + cost caps
- **Risk:** needs safety rails (overload protection, cost budgets)

### 5) Vector Memory with Receipts (Reliability Plane)

**Promise:** Persistent memory is trustworthy — durable, validated, auditable.  

- Qdrant live writes + semantic chunking + tagging
- Signed receipts for every memory operation
- **Priority:** eliminate fallbacks, make real vector writes stable

### 6) Bio-Inspired Swarm Intelligence (Learning Plane)

**Promise:** System that teaches itself and improves autonomously.

- HeadySwarm: 30 flowers, 5 bees, circadian rhythm scheduling
- Ant Colony Optimization, Fibonacci scaling, stigmergy coordination
- Honeycomb persistence with quality scoring across 8 categories

## Positioning Lines

- "Verify before you ship."
- "Policy before execution."
- "Trusted memory, signed actions."
- "One capability plane, many surfaces."
- "We don't generate more. We verify better."
