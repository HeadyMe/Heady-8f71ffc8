## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Looks complex" | Start with IDE/Buddy. Expand when value is proven. |
| "Can we trust AI changes?" | We provide consensus + audit + verification. |
| "Are connectors safe?" | Safety is first-class: allowlists, approvals, sandboxing. |
