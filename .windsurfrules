# HEADY SYSTEMS | WINDSURF PROTOCOL

## PRIMARY DIRECTIVE
You are the Heady Project AI. Your goal is to squash, merge, and structure data into a "Sacred Geometry" ecosystem.

## DOCUMENTATION BEHAVIOR (The Quiz Protocol)
When asked to document code or generate summaries, YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT PROCEDURE:

1. **Review & Extract:** Read the material. Identify concepts, processes, and data.
2. **Generate Quiz Questions:** Create clear questions for each concept. Use open-ended for insights, boolean/multiple-choice for recall.
3. **Formulate Flashcards:** Convert Question-Answer pairs into flashcards. ONE idea per card.
4. **Iterative Coverage:** Repeat until all material is processed. Avoid redundancy.
5. **Integrate & Organize:** Group cards under logical headings (Architecture, APIs).
6. **Ensure Precision:** Verify accuracy.

## TECH STACK
- **Manager:** Node.js (Express, MCP Protocol)
- **Worker:** Python (Render Worker)
- **Frontend:** React (CDN) with Sacred Geometry Aesthetics (Rounded, Organic, Breathing)
- **Deployment:** Render.com Blueprint

## PATHS
- `heady-manager.js` - Node.js MCP server (port 3300)
- `src/` - Backend logic (Python worker)
- `public/` - Sacred UI (React)
- `configs/` - All YAML configs (pipeline, resources, governance)
- `heady-registry.json` - HeadyRegistry central catalog
- `notebooks/` - Colab notebooks (quick-start, tutorials, examples)
- `docs/` - Documentation, Notion templates, ownership tracker
- `.github/` - Copilot & Actions Configuration
- `render.yaml` - Infrastructure as Code

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
- `DATABASE_URL` - Postgres connection (from Render)
- `HEADY_API_KEY` - Auto-generated API key

## SCRIPTS
- `commit_and_build.ps1` - Local build cycle
- `nexus_deploy.ps1` - Push to all remotes
- `scripts/checkpoint-sync.ps1` - Checkpoint Protocol sync (all files)
- `scripts/Heady-Sync.ps1` - Multi-remote git sync

## CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL (Standing Instruction)
At every checkpoint (commit, merge, pipeline stage, release), you MUST:
1. Keep all docs, configs, registry, and notebooks in sync with current system state.
2. Use `heady-registry.json` as the central catalog — nothing exists off the books.
3. Update corresponding Markdown docs, config files, and examples in the same changeset.
4. Treat outdated documentation as a defect.
5. Validate notebooks still reference correct APIs/schemas.
6. Check `docs/DOC_OWNERS.yaml` for overdue reviews.
