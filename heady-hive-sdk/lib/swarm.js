 * Manages a colony of HeadyBee workers that continuously forage
 * for AI results through the HeadyGateway. Models real bee behavior:
 *
 *   - Flower Field: prioritized task queue (the work to be done)
 *   - Waggle Dance: successful bees recruit others to high-yield categories
 *   - Honeycomb: persistent result store for proven AI outputs
 *   - Energy Cycles: bees rest between foraging rounds
 *   - Division of Labor: roles assigned based on colony needs
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const swarm = new HeadySwarm(gateway, { beeCount: 5 });
 *   swarm.start();
 *   // ... later
 *   swarm.status();
